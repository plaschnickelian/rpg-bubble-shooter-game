## Overview

This Unity-based game blends two classic genres to create a unique gameplay experience. It combines the strategic elements of a turn-based RPG with the fast-paced action of a bubble-shooter.

In the turn-based RPG mode, players and enemies alternate attacks, each planning their moves carefully. The twist comes with the bubble-shooter minigame, where matching four bubbles of the same color determines
the actions available in combat. Each color match grants a different ability, and matching a set number of bubbles unlocks a special attack.

However, players must be cautious: if an enemy lands a hit or the bubbles reach too far, the player will lose health. This blend of strategy and quick thinking offers a fresh and challenging gameplay experience.
